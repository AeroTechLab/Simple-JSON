# Simple JSON

Standalone (single source file, no additional dependencies) library for manipulating [JSON](http://www.json.org/) formatted data, including:

- Reading JSON strings to data structures
- Generating JSON strings from JSON data structures
- Creating JSON data structure from scratch (initially empty)
- Adding and deleting JSON fields/nodes
- Reading and writing JSON field values

This project is intended for embedded systems, where there is no available version of more mature libraries like [JSON-C](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) and [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp).

### Documentation

Descriptions of how the functions and data structures work are available at the [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)-generated [documentation pages](https://labdin.github.io/Simple-JSON/json_8h.html).
